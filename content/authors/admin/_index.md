Sean Goral a Life Scientist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). His work primarily involves Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) site remediation.

Sean is a 2019 graduate from a Master's program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, UCSB. At Bren, he specialized in pollution prevention and remediation with a focus in environmental data science. His other scientific interests include resource protection, conservation biology, epidural stimulation technology, and brain computer interface technology. 

In 2015, Sean collaborated with a service dog non-profit organization called Canine Assistants, and he was featured in service dog advocacy multimedia content to promote the Canine Assistants organization and its sponsors.

In 2014, Sean became a certified spinal cord injury peer mentor with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation following a traumatic car accident in 2013. During that same post-accident year, Sean also finished his undergraduate studies to earn his Bachelor of Science in Biology.
